# 👋 Hello! I'm Marc

### Full Stack Developer | JavaScript | Blockchain & Web3 | Renewable Energy Enthusiast
---

I always say: **_'Better spend 4 hours automating a process rather than spend 1 min doing it manually.'_**  It’s all about **thinking long-term** and creating efficient solutions. 

When I discovered blockchain technology, I was captivated by its potential to revolutionize the internet. That’s when I decided to focus on full-stack programming to interact with blockchain and Web3 — the future of the internet as I see it.

My journey into blockchain deepened when I uncovered the real truth about Bitcoin (thnk you Roger Ver) — its real purpose and transformative power. Since then, I’ve been hooked, dedicating myself to building a bright future around this technology. Blockchain isn’t just a tool; it’s a necessity for humanity to achieve transparency, security, and decentralization in an increasingly digital world.
